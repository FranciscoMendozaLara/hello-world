# hello-world

Carlos Francisco Mendoza here!

Mathematical and statistical analysis enthusiast. Passionate about music, and science in general. I love measuring things, gathering evidence and building models to make data-driven decisions. I enjoy doing it in both my professional and personal life. Although in life I like to let things flow. I aim to drive my performance with the highest standards and to achieve goals in a team-based environment.
